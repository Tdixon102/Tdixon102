My GitHub account was created September 22, 2023 on a MacBook Air. 
The repository I created was done so by following the instructions on the lab assignment, I have no formal knowledge of GitHub so this is all new to me. 
I had to fisrt create the repository, then clone it, and in cloning it into the GitHub desktop application.
